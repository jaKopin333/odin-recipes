    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cups water</li>
        <li>150g Unsalted butter for dough</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Unsalted Butter for sautéing veggies + dumplings</li>
        <li>1 lb fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup bacon pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare ingredients for the recipe.</li>
        <li>Place the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a little well in the middle. Place whisked eggs, water, and melted butter into it. Using a fork, work the ingredients together to form the dough. Finish up combining the ingredients by hand until you get a smooth, even texture.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into eight even pieces. On a floured surface, roll each piece into a long string. Dice each string into small pieces.</li>
        <li>At this point, you can either freeze the raw dough for later use or move onto the next step to cook them.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Toss in the raw dumplings and boil them until they float to the top.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Topping Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the topping ingredients.</li>
        <li>Dice mushrooms and sauté them in a buttered skillet for about 5 minutes. Dice the onions and add them to the skillet, cooking them until softened. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir in bacon pieces, sauté for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dumplings into a nonstick skillet and add in sautéed mixture and butter. Cook until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
